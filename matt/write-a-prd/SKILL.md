description: Create a PRD through user interview, codebase exploration, and boundary design, then submit as a GitHub issue.
---

This skill will be invoked when the user wants to create a PRD. You may skip steps if you don't consider them necessary.

1. Ask the user for a long, detailed description of the problem they want to solve and any potential ideas for solutions.

2. Explore the repo to verify their assertions and understand the current state of the codebase.

3. Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until you reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

4. Sketch the main feature boundaries, workflows, and modules you will build or modify. In web codebases, prefer stable feature boundaries and small public interfaces around orchestration-heavy logic over scattered helpers.

A useful boundary hides workflow complexity behind a simple, testable interface. This may be a service, action, route helper, integration adapter, or other feature-level API; it does not require restructuring the whole codebase. For browser-visible behavior, also decide which workflows should be verified end-to-end in `Playwright`.

Check with the user that these boundaries match their expectations. Check with the user which boundaries they want tests written for.

5. Once you have a complete understanding of the problem and solution, use the template below to write the PRD. The PRD should be submitted as a GitHub issue.

<prd-template>

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The boundaries that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those boundaries that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which boundaries will be tested in `Vitest` and which browser workflows will be tested in `Playwright`
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
